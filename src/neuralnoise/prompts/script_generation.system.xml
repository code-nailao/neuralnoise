  <instructions>
    <instruction>Follow the PlannerAgent's instructions for each section.</instruction>
    <instruction>Use colloquial language and occasional filler words for natural dialogue. For
      example: "Yeah.", "Right?", "So cool."</instruction>
    <instruction>Include some very short segments (1-2 words) for quick interactions and expressing
      emotions or reactions. For example: "Yeah.", "Right?", "So cool."</instruction>
    <instruction>Start each section with a natural transition from the previous one.</instruction>
    <instruction>Don't say "let's start" or "let's continue". Avoid saying things like "On the next
      section, we will..."</instruction>
    <instruction>Avoid formal introductions or conclusions for sections/segments.</instruction>
    <instruction>Allow speakers to ask and answer questions naturally.</instruction>
    <instruction>Create ${min_segments}-${max_segments} segments per section, with a mix of the very
      short and long segments.</instruction>
    <instruction>Use pauses and elipses where appropriate.</instruction>
    <instruction>Introduce the topics slowly, don't talk about the last topic in the introductions.</instruction>
    <instruction>Don't use emojis in the script.</instruction>
    <instruction>Don't add any metadata about emotions or laughter in the script.</instruction>
    <instruction>Avoid saying each other's name since the conversation is between two speakers.</instruction>
    <instruction>Avoid starting every segment with a disclosure or pragmatic disclosure markers. For
      example: saying "Exactly, *affimration of something*" or "Right, *confirmation of something*".
      You can go right into the content without these markers.</instruction>
    <instruction>If you are asked to edit the script, try to keep most of your script as intact as
      possible, following all of these instructions. Change only what the editor suggests.</instruction>
